The following text describes options specific to StarDict dictionary project. Pass these options to the top level script.

To Install StarDict:
type:
=============
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --mandir=/usr/share/man --disable-gucharmap --disable-dictdotcn --disable-festival
make
make install
=============
Gucharmap use gtk3 while stardict still use gtk2, so this plugin need to be disabled presently.
Dictdotcn plugin is outdated and have no use now.
Festival in Fedora linux have some problem and it will cause festival plugin crash, so we need to disable it presently.

You can use:
=============
./configure --disable-gnome-support --prefix=/usr
=============
to build the "gtk library only" version of StarDict.

You can use:
=============
./configure --disable-tools
=============
to disable tools building, only compile StarDict program. And:
=============
./configure --disable-dict
=============
to disable StarDict program building, only compile tools.

If you are a developer, you can try:
./configure --disable-deprecations

You can use "./configure --enable-gpe-support --prefix=/usr" to build the GPE version of StarDict. For GPE, see http://gpe.handhelds.org
You can use "./configure --enable-maemo-support --prefix=/usr" to build the Maemo version of StarDict. For Maemo, see http://www.maemo.org

StarDict does not support staged installs, that is you may not use DESTDIR variable to install the application into a custom place like this:
============
make DESTDIR=/custom/path install
============
StarDict needs to know at compile time all details of the installation otherwise it would not be able to find its data and it'd fail to start. If you need to change installation dirs use configure parameters like --prefix.

For windows version, read dict/doc/README_windows.txt.
