stardict (2.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * [debian/control]
     - Oops!  2.4.5-0.1 failed to build from source!  Mea culpa!
       Added Build-Depends: libxml-parser-perl
     - Added myself to the Uploaders field.  :-)

  * While hunting down on libxml-parser-perl dependency, I decided to learn
    more about intltools and to fix up "make distclean" leftovers:
     - [autogen.sh]: Run intltoolize too.
     - [Makefile.am]: Added "DISTCLEANFILES = intltool-extract intltool-merge
        intltool-update"
     - Updated omf.make and xmldocs.make from gnome-common (2.8.0-3).
       This cleans out help/*/stardict-*.omf.out.
     - Ran ./autogen.sh (with automake1.9 and intltools pre-installed).
     - The new intltool (0.34) scripts clean up po/.intltool-merge-cache
       and po/*.gmo.  Also, stardict.desktop (etc.) entries finally
       show up in the PO files again.

  * [debian/rules]: Changed --localstatedir=/var/lib to /var.
