/* 
 Is there any way to know that selection is changed?
 So we don't need to get selection text every interval milliseconds
 and compare the text to know whether selection changed.
 I tried the "selection_notify_event", but it means that some one is requesting the selection.
 if you use the "selection-clear-event", so when selection is changed,you will get this event,
 but it need you do a gtk_selection_owner_set,this make the old selection be cleared :(

 OK, there is no way the know the selection is changed...
 Is there any way to only get the selection's text with a limit length,
 but not the whole text? Stardict only need the first 256 chars....it seems no way too :(
